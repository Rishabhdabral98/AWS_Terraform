### 📘 Introduction to Terraform

#### ✅ What is Terraform?

Terraform is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to **define, provision, and manage your infrastructure** using simple, human-readable configuration files written in **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**.

#### ❓ Why is Terraform important?

Managing infrastructure manually is:

* ❌ Time-consuming
* ❌ Error-prone
* ❌ Difficult to replicate

Terraform solves this by:

* ✅ Automating infrastructure deployment
* ✅ Making infrastructure **declarative** and version-controlled (like code!)
* ✅ Supporting **multi-cloud** environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
* ✅ Allowing you to **track changes** and apply updates safely using its **plan → apply → destroy** workflow

#### 🔧 What Problems Does Terraform Solve?

* Manual provisioning of cloud resources
* Lack of standardization in environments (dev/stage/prod)
* No visibility into infrastructure changes
* Hard to manage complex dependencies

With Terraform, you can:

* Recreate the same infra again and again (Idempotency)
* Version-control your infrastructure
* Collaborate like developers using Git
* Integrate with CI/CD pipelines easily

#### 🌩️ Why Terraform with AWS?

We’ll be learning Terraform with **AWS** because:

* AWS is the most widely-used cloud platform
* Terraform supports all major AWS services
* Real-world use cases like VPC, EC2, IAM, and S3 are easier to understand with AWS

---

#### 🎯 What Will You Learn?

In this course, we’ll cover:

* Terraform basics: installation, providers, resources, variables
* Creating AWS infrastructure like VPCs, EC2 instances, IAM roles
* Writing reusable modules
* Best practices like remote state, workspaces, and state locking
* Deploying real projects using Terraform
